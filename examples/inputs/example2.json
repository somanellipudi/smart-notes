  "external_context": "From Calculus Textbook Chapter 5 - Integration:\n\nIntegration is the inverse operation of differentiation. While differentiation asks 'what is the rate of change?', integration asks 'what function has this as its rate of change?' This inverse relationship is formalized in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nAntiderivatives: If F'(x) = f(x), we call F an antiderivative of f. Note that antiderivatives are not unique - if F is an antiderivative of f, so is F + C for any constant C. This is because the derivative of a constant is zero.\n\nIndefinite Integrals: The notation ∫f(x)dx represents the family of all antiderivatives of f(x). The 'dx' indicates that we're integrating with respect to x. The result always includes '+ C' to represent the arbitrary constant.\n\nIntegration Techniques: While some functions can be integrated using basic rules (like the power rule), many require special techniques:\n- Substitution (u-substitution): Used when the integrand is a composition of functions\n- Integration by parts: Based on the product rule for differentiation\n- Partial fractions: For rational functions\n- Trigonometric substitution: For certain algebraic expressions\n\nApplications: Integration is used to calculate areas, volumes, work, center of mass, probability, and many other quantities. In physics, if you know acceleration, you can integrate to find velocity; integrate velocity to find position.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration, showing they are inverse operations. Part 1 states that if F(x) = ∫ₐˣ f(t)dt, then F'(x) = f(x)."
