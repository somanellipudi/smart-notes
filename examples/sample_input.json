  "external_context": "From Calculus Textbook Chapter 3:\n\nThe derivative is one of the fundamental concepts in calculus. It measures how a function changes as its input changes. More precisely, the derivative of a function at a point is the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point.\n\nGeometric Interpretation: The derivative at a point represents the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point. This connects the algebraic definition with visual understanding.\n\nPhysical Interpretation: In physics, if s(t) represents position as a function of time, then s'(t) represents velocity. Similarly, if v(t) is velocity, then v'(t) is acceleration.\n\nThe limit definition, while fundamental, can be tedious to apply. In subsequent sections, we'll develop rules and shortcuts for computing derivatives efficiently."
