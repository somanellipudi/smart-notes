Lecture: Integration and Antiderivatives

Main Topics:
- Integration as reverse of differentiation
- Indefinite integrals
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 1)
- Integration techniques: substitution

Key Concepts:

1. Antiderivative
   F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x) if F'(x) = f(x)
   
2. Indefinite Integral
   ∫f(x)dx = F(x) + C
   where C is the constant of integration

3. Power Rule for Integration
   ∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C  (for n ≠ -1)

Example 1: Find ∫3x² dx
Solution:
∫3x² dx = 3∫x² dx
        = 3 · (x³/3) + C
        = x³ + C

Check: d/dx(x³ + C) = 3x² ✓

Example 2: Substitution Method
Find ∫2x(x²+1)⁵ dx

Let u = x² + 1
Then du = 2x dx

∫2x(x²+1)⁵ dx = ∫u⁵ du
                = u⁶/6 + C
                = (x²+1)⁶/6 + C

Common Mistakes:
- Forgetting the constant of integration C
- Incorrect application of substitution
- Not checking the result by differentiating

Applications:
- Finding displacement from velocity
- Calculating area under curves
- Probability distributions
- Accumulated quantities
