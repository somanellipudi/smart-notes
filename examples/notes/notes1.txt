Today: Introduction to Derivatives

Key Ideas:
- Derivative = rate of change
- Instantaneous vs average rate
- Geometric interpretation: slope of tangent line
- Notation: dy/dx, f'(x), df/dx

Definition:
The derivative of f at x is:
lim (h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h

This is called the difference quotient.

Example 1: f(x) = x²
Find f'(x) using the definition.

Solution:
f'(x) = lim (h→0) [(x+h)² - x²] / h
     = lim (h→0) [x² + 2xh + h² - x²] / h
     = lim (h→0) [2xh + h²] / h
     = lim (h→0) [2x + h]
     = 2x

Therefore: d/dx(x²) = 2x

Common Mistakes:
- Forgetting the limit process
- Dividing by zero before taking the limit
- Confusing average rate with instantaneous rate

Real-world applications:
- Velocity (rate of change of position)
- Acceleration (rate of change of velocity)
- Marginal cost in economics
- Population growth rates
